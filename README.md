Description: This application is designed to use web crawling and show what’s trending in the news or any set of websites in particular. The application is written entirely in Java. Various third party libraries were utilized for key operations such as fetching the webpages (JSoup), creating the tag cloud (Opencloud). The application incorporates features such as:
•	Crawling the webpages until a certain depth
•	GUI features from the Swing and JavaFX libraries
•	Java Collections such as Hash sets, Linked Lists, Dictionaries, and Array Lists to store and manage data from the crawled websites.
•	Tag cloud from the words obtained from the analysis of text obtained from the crawled webpages.
•	Web links from the words in the tag cloud to the corresponding website.
